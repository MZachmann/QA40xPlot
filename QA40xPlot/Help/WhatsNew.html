<h1>v 1.2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan 24, 2026</h1>
<h2>Risk Summary</h2>
<p>The plot limit changes are medium risk but strictly gui. The relay timing change might be problematic but it&#39;s noticeably quicker.</p>
<h2>Add Blackman-Harris-7 Window</h2>
<p>Blackman-Harris 7 is a nice windowing scheme so it&#39;s now available (Blackman-7).</p>
<h2>Repair renaming files</h2>
<p>With the switch to .ZIP file format (instead of gzip) a bug was introduced causing load to fail if the file was renamed. That has been repaired.</p>
<h2>Reduce relay time</h2>
<p>Continuing to try to get ultra-stable results while spending as little time waiting as possible. A few empirical tests were done and some relay wait times were decreased by a second+.</p>
<h2>Reduce effect when graph limits change</h2>
<p>Especially for pin, having the graph readjust a lot was annoying. Now only the axis being changed adjusts. Also, pin is now way more exact and should be far more useful.</p>
<h2>Add Pin All and Fit All to graph popup menu</h2>
<p>The default ScottPlot graph popup menu wasn&#39;t very useful and now it is. Do all axes at once. Right-click the graph.</p>

<h1>v 1.2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan 24, 2026</h1>
<h2>Risk Summary</h2>
<p>Frequency Response tests have had extensive changes. Otherwise, these are primarily esthetic improvements and small additional features so hopefully slight risk.</p>
<h2>Add QA40x readings upper right</h2>
<p>On the upper right of the screen (if menus are enabled) it now shows the USB DC Voltage and current as well as the (I think) internal temperature. These values only get updated each time a sweep runs.</p>
<h2>Add editor for Get plots test info</h2>
<p>When you get a saved plot to display there is now an edit button in the left-side GUI. That brings up a dialog that lets you change the plot name so it reads better in the Legend. You can also view/edit the heading and description. A save button was added to allow the changes to go back to the saved plot file. When a saved test is Gotten with a blank Name field, the app uses the file name to identify the lines in the Legend.</p>
<h2>Add a default data folder setting</h2>
<p>Adds a Settings option to put all your saved tests and configurations into a specific default folder. This does not affect QADefault.cfg, which always comes from your Documents folder unless supplied on the command line at startup. This setting just defines the starting folder when you click a get, save, or load button.</p>
<h2>Add a group delay display to impedance and gain tests</h2>
<p>This is a very early implementation of group delay. It is always in ms and shows up in a tentative second Y axis.</p>
<h2>Add Shift-Click option to legend labels for a legend group</h2>
<p>Hold down a shift key while clicking a legend checkbox (in the legend window) and the entire group of lines with the same suffix (after the @) will hide/show. This
helps deal with the large number of plot lines in the THD vs Amplitude and vs Frequency tests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>v 1.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan 18, 2026</h1>
<h2>Risk Summary</h2>
<p>Start, Run, and Stop now work somewhat differently so there may be cases where they fail to enable correctly.
    Over the last few releases some objects have changed names so it is probably <strong>time to delete your default configuration file</strong>
    and start over with factory defaults.
</p>
<h2>Update cursor value each time test repeats</h2>
<p>For tests that run repeatedly, update the mouse cursor display after a test runs. It was requiring a mouse move to update the displayed value.</p>

<h2>Add a Residual waveform display to the Scope test</h2>
<p>Per user requests, this adds the ability to show the residual time series (data - fundamental) to the plot. It will be listed in the &quot;Get&quot; list on the left
    where either channel can be shown or hidden and colors may be manually set. This waveform is (currently) calculated by removing all spectral content within a sixth-octave of the fundamental. This uses the known test-channel fundamental frequency if generator 1 is enabled otherwise it reads the fundamental from the spectral peak.</p>
<h2>Do not allow test switching during Run</h2>
<p>Switching test pages while running a test was never a good idea but there was no program stop. Now it&#39;s explicit and you&#39;ll get a warning when you try to flip tests during a run.
</p>
<h1>v 1.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jan 13, 2026</h1>
<h2>Risk Summary</h2>
<p>
    The gain curve math updates are problematic. QA40xPlot uses gain curves for auto-attenuation of IMD, Amplitude and Frequency sweeps, and Response. The unit of measure changes on amplitude (voltage) selection runs through every test and should work ok but now that they save/load with configuration there could be issues.</p>
<h2>Fixup selection of Transparent in color picker</h2>
<p>
    Transparent color is used as an indicator to use the default color from the color palette for these chart lines so it should be easy to select. This fixes requiring setting it twice to stick.</p>
<h2>Improve gain curve frequency selection</h2>
<p>
    The gain curve algorithm, which calculates required attenuation in sweep tests, did some band limiting out of the audio range that could cause issues when testing high frequency response. It now uses at least your specified frequency range for the gain curve test.</p>
<h2>Add a continuous mode Run button to the Response/Gain/Crosstalk/Impedance tests</h2>
<p>
    Particularly when using Chirp, which runs quickly, support repeating these tests, which allows for tuning circuits.</p>
<h2>Swap Start to Run for spectrum, imd, and scope tests</h2>
<p>
    This makes Run and Start more consistent for the tests. Run == run repeatedly whereas Start = run once</p>
<h2>Add F5,F6,F7 accelerators for run/start/stop</h2>
<p>
    Enable keyboard accelerators for run, start and stop. Use Function keys F5,F6,F7 to avoid conflicts with the left hand GUI panel choices.</p>
<h2>Support saving and loading amplitude UOM</h2>
<p>
    Untether the amplitude value from the Unit of Measure (maybe temporarily) to allow for saving the Unit.</p>
<h2>Improve generator voltage messaging</h2>
<p>
    Add a dBxx display in generator voltage to match Unit when user selects a logarithmic unit.</p>
<h2>Upgrade esthetics of voltage unit button</h2>
<p>
    Hopefully it is more obvious and esthetic.</p>
<h2>Add Whats New file and menu option</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
