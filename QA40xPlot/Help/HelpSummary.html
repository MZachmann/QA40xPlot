<h1 style="color:red">Common Options</h1>
<h1>Keyboard Accelerators</h1>
<p>
    The left hand user interface entries on every tab are accessible by Alt-key combinations. Press and release the Alt key to
    see underlines appear on the prompts. Each underlined letter is a keyboard accelerator. So Alt-V, for example, usually lets you
    edit the voltage entry. Alt-R turns auto-ranging on and off, etc.
</p>

<h1>Graph Manipulation</h1>
<p>Common to all tests are plots of values. You can change them easily by</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click a plot and drag the mouse to move the plot center point around.</li>
    <li>Right-click a plot and drag the mouse to zoom in or out in the mouse direction.</li>
    <li>Scroll the mouse wheel in a plot to zoom in or out</li>
    <li>Click a plot axis and drag the mouse to reposition that axis.</li>
    <li>Right-click a plot axis and drag the mouse to zoom in or out that axis.</li>
    <li>Scroll the mouse wheel over a plot axis to zoom that axis in or out</li>
    <li>--</li>
    <li>Click inside the plot to freeze a cursor. Click again to unfreeze.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Amplitude Definitions</h1>
<p>All tests have a choice as to how the QA40x generator voltage is determined.</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="auto-style5">Setting</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="auto-style5"><strong>Input Voltage</strong></td>
            <td>The desired DUT input voltage. This is the QA40x generator output voltage.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="auto-style5"><strong>Output Voltage</strong></td>
            <td>The desired DUT output voltage / QA40x input voltage. This does a low-voltage gain calculation (exactly the same as the autoranging math) first to determine the generator voltage.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="auto-style5"><strong>Output Power</strong></td>
            <td>Use the amplifier load setting (see Settings) to determine output voltage from power and then use gain to calculate the input/generator voltage</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<h1>Attenuation Settings</h1>
<p>QA40x attenuation is important for test device integrity. QA40xPlot tries very hard to use just enough attenuation for each test. Attenuation is always calculated based on both input channels (left and right) of the QA40x. If you only plan to test one channel we recommend you short the other QA40x input channel, which will guarantee that attenuation math ignores the shorted channel.</p>
<p>The free-running tests: Spectrum, Intermodulation and Scope, have manual or automatic attenuation. The other tests all automatically check gain then automatically determine attenuation to avoid QA40x overload in either channel.</p>
<p>The THD vs Frequency sweep calculates/uses one generator voltage that it then sweeps with. If you select an output amplitude that voltage ensures the maximum output of the sweep is that setting. The Input Voltage setting uses that voltage for the sweep.</p>
<p>The THD vs Amplitude test calculates distortion at each swept amplitude and varies generator voltage accordingly. Attenuation may increase as output voltage increases.</p>
<p>All 3 response tests (Response, Gain, Impedance) use a single generator voltage just like the THD vs Frequency test.</p>
<p>For tests that are sinusoidal (spectrum, thd vs frequency/amplitude) the gain is calculated at the fundamental frequency. For tests over a frequency range the gain is calculated using two frequencies or a chirp range.</p>
<h1>Cursor</h1>
<p>All of the tests support a <strong>cursor</strong>. As you move your mouse in the plot a small box in the lower right shows the nearest data point. Some charts have a visual on-screen point, some don&#39;t.</p>
<h1>Tab Get, Load, and Save</h1>
<p>
    Each tab has a Get, a Load and a Save button in the left hand column at the bottom. When saved, the tab settings and plot data
    are saved to a compressed .plt file (by default named something.plt.zip). This file can be manually opened in Windows and the contents are a JSON text file. It can also, of course,
    be loaded.
</p>
<p>
    When a saved tab is loaded two things happen. First, the plot data is displayed. Second, the original sweep settings are
    entered back into the user interface. So, the screen will look exactly as it did when the sweep/test was run. This lets you know
    exactly what settings you used for the test. It also allows for limited examination of the plot data.
</p>
<p>
    When a saved tab is gotten (Get) the name will show up under the button with an L and R checkbox.
    By default L is usually clicked on when gotten. Click the L and R to show/hide each channel.
    Click the color boxes next to the L and R to change the plot line colors.
    Add more saved tests by clicking the Get button again.
    Click the garbage icon to remove a saved tab. This will not delete the file on-disk.
</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Settings</h1>
<h1>The global Settings tab</h1>
<p>
    There is one tab named "Settings" that shows the various global settings. These include colors, color themes,
    amplifier load, external gain block, and others.
</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Test Descriptions</h1>
<h1 style="color:green">Spectrum Test</h1>
<p>This test sends a single sine wave out from the generator and plots the received frequency spectral data (value vs frequency). For a Sine wave this produces a skinny spike at the sine frequency surrounded by background noise and (usually harmonic) distortion spikes.</p>

<h1 style="color:green">THD vs Amplitude Test</h1>
<p>This test does a sweep from start to end voltage or power. At each amplitude it tests the harmonic distortion products and plots the resultant set of 5-8 line segments.</p>

<h1 style="color:green">Response Test</h1>
<p>
    This is a conventional frequency response test. The output is in dBV and can cover both channels or just one.
</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use Chirp - turn this on to use a chirp signal for the sweep. This is a more efficient way to sweep a frequency range. It suffers from
        reduced distortion and gain accuracy but gains almost continuous frequency coverage in a single packet. When using chirp, the right channel is used as reference if active.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1 style="color:green">Impedance Test</h1>
<p>This does a frequency sweep and at each point calculates the effective impedance of the DUT. Data is stored as a complex value.</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use Chirp - turn this on to use a chirp signal for the sweep. This is a more efficient way to sweep a frequency range. It suffers from
        reduced distortion and gain accuracy but gains almost continuous frequency coverage in a single packet.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Connections are:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>DUT terminal A to ground</li>
    <li>DUT terminal B to reference resistor terminal A and QA40x Left Input</li>
    <li>reference resistor terminal B and generator output to QA40x Right Input</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="color:green">Gain Test</h1>
<p>This does a traditional Bode Plot of Gain and Phase vs frequency. Here the right channel is used as a reference channel. </p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use Chirp - see above.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Connections are:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> the QA40x right channel input to the DUT input port and generator output.</li>
    <li> the QA40x left channel input to the DUT output port.</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="color:green">Crosstalk Test</h1>
<p>
    This does a traditional crosstalk analysis of the two input channels vs frequency. Here retain the left and right channels through. QA40xPlot turns the left and
    right channels on/off during the test.
</p>
<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use Chirp - this will do the crosstalk via chirp. Chirp accuracy at low levels of crosstalk (below 80dB) is iffy.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Connections are:</h3>
<ul>
    <li> the QA40x right channel output to the DUT right input.</li>
    <li> the QA40x left channel output to the DUT left input.</li>
    <li> the QA40x right channel input to the DUT right output.</li>
    <li> the QA40x left channel input to the DUT left output.</li>
</ul>
