<p>The QA40xPlot application consists of 8 different audio tests that use a QA402 or QA403 audio analyzer from QuantAsylum.</p>
<h1>Graph Manipulation</h1>
<p>Common to all tests are plots of values. You can change them easily by</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click a plot and drag the mouse to move the plot center point around.</li>
    <li>Scroll the mouse wheel in a plot to zoom in or out</li>
    <li>Scroll the mouse wheel over a plot axis to zoom only that axis in or out</li>
    <li>Click inside the plot to freeze a cursor. Click again to unfreeze.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Amplitude Definitions</h1>
<p>All tests have a choice as to amplitude definition.</p>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Input Voltage</strong></td>
            <td>Interpret voltages as QA40x generator settings.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Output Voltage</strong></td>
            <td>Determine voltage to achieve the desired output. This always does a gain calculation first</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Output Power</strong></td>
            <td>Use the amplifier load setting (see Settings) to determine output voltage from power and then use gain to calculate the input voltage</td>

<p>The spectral tests (Spectrum and Intermodulation) have manual or automatic attenuation. The other tests are all automatic to avoid QA40x overload in either channel.</p>
<p>The THD vs Frequency sweep calculates/uses one generator voltage that it then sweeps with. If you select an output amplitude that voltage<br>ensures the maximum output of the sweep is that setting. The Input Voltage setting uses that voltage for the sweep.</p>
<p>The THD vs Amplitude test calculates distortion at each swept amplitude and varies generator voltage accordingly. Attenuation may increase as output voltage increases.</p>
<p>All 3 response tests (Response, Gain, Impedance) use a single generator voltage just like<br>the THD vs Frequency test.</p>
<h1>Attenuation Settings</h1>
<p>QA40x attenuation is important for test device integrity. QA40xPlot tries very hard to use enough<br>attenuation for each test. Attenuation is always calculated based on both input channels (left and right) of the QA40x. If you only plan to test one channel we<br>recommend you short the other QA40x input channel, which will guarantee that<br>attenuation math ignores the shorted channel.</p>
<h1>Cursor</h1>
<p>All of the tests support a <strong>cursor</strong>. As you move your mouse in the plot a small box in the lower right<br>shows the nearest data point. Some charts have a visual on-screen point, some don&#39;t.</p>
<h1>Spectrum Test</h1>
<p>This test sends a single sine wave out from the generator and plots the received<br>frequency spectral data (value vs frequency). For a Sine wave this produces<br>a skinny spike at the sine frequency surrounded by background noise<br>and (usually harmonic) distortion spikes.</p>

<h1>Response Test</h1>
<p>This is a conventional frequency response test. The output is in dBV<br>and can cover both channels or just one.</p>
<h1>Impedance Test</h1>
<p>This does a frequency sweep and at each point calculates the effective<br>impedance of the DUT. Data is stored as a complex value.</p>
<p>Connections are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>DUT terminal A to ground</li>
    <li>DUT terminal B to reference resistor terminal A and Left Input</li>
    <li>reference resistor terminal B and generator output to Right Input</li>
</ul>
<h1>Gain Test</h1>
<p>This does a traditional Bode Plot of Gain and Phase vs frequency.<br>Here the right channel is used as a reference channel. Connect the<br>right channel input to the DUT input port and generator output.</p>
