* SMSL DO100 - works fine. Supports 32 bits-per-sample and all sample rates in exclusive mode. 
 Latency about 20ms. Volume~80 matches QA40x.

* Atom DAC+ - works fine. Supports 32 bits-per-sample and all sample rates in exclusive mode. 
  Latency about 20ms.

* Motu M4 - works OK but the WASAPI driver only supports shared mode and seemingly only at your Windows audio settings 
so in Windows Sound Output settings set the M4 sample rate to what you run your tests at for best results.

* PreSonus Studio 26c - was unable to get this to connect compatibly. It does not report any PCM or Ieee formats.
