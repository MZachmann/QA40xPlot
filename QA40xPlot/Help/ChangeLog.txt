The QA40xPlot Changelog
--------------------------------------------
This changelog shows the changes made and the released via github
--------------------------------------------
v 1.1.10
- repair IMD signal to noise math when a frequency is near 20KHz
- repair tab save never highlights in THD vs amp and THD vs frequency
- repair unit name in THD vs amp Y axis
- start capturing on perceived data start rather than immediately
- remove double-scan for gain tests and instead correctly
  allow time for circuit to settle after relays switch
  based on empirical test of relay vs signal
v 1.1.9
- refine the esthetics, like boundary of graph
- support settable background color
- refactor most of the gui xaml by using subcontrols
v 1.1.8
- totally refactor the usb/rest code to use an interface & factory
-- yank out REST use of 'internal' oscillators and queries
- remove redundant color code to slim binding way down

v 1.1.5
- repair popup windows initial visual state

- add tab info display to each tab window
- add a REST support layer to allow either interface
v 1.1.1, 1.1.2
- start tab load/save implementation
- improve settling issues when noise measurement
- set the device to Attenuation when a test finishes so the device stays attenuated
- improvements to the thd/snr/noise algorithms
v 1.1.0
